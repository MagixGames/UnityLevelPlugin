# This project is currently not being worked on due to a big issue (maybe you can solve!)
I can't figure out how to properly translate rotations from FB to Unity. It sounds simple, and oh my god is it not. I've been working on it for 9 days now and have gotten fucking nowhere. If you would like to solve it, I'd legitimately give anything
### PLEASE PR IF YOU FIND A FIX PLEASEEEE
## Notes for development
- The frosty output path is hardcoded rn, just change it to something u want
- THE UNITY PROJECT MUST BE A **UNIVERSAL 3D** PROJECT
